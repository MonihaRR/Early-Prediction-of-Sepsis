# Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis
 This work is based on an open source data which is a Physionet chalIenge 2019. In this project, a prediction model for sepsis has been developed. The data is first explored and cleansed to get an appropriate meta-data. The meta-data serves as an input to the prediction model. Prediction model using logistic regression and KNN was built and accuracy for the respective models was calculated.
